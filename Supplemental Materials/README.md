# Description of Supplemental Materials  
Supplemental materials for Bryant, DeMarco, and Hallem (2021).  

## Supplemental Files  
File S1 contains a code freeze of the *Strongyloides* RNA-seq Browser.  

File S2 contains metadata tables for the four *Strongyloides* species data included in the *Strongyloides* RNA-seq Browser. For all species, metadata information was retrieved from the European Nucleotide Archive. For *Strongyloides stercoralis*, additional protocol information was retrieved from ArrayExpress.  

File S3 contains low-count genes and associated log2CPM values discarded during preprocessing.  

File S4 contains a list of the top 10% of genes contributing to PC1 and PC2 identity for each species. Genes were extracted based on PCA variable scores using tidyverse package v1.3.0.  

File S5 contains a list of chemoreceptor gene IDs for all *Strongyloides* species (Wheeler *et al.* 2020, Langeland *et al.* 2020).  

File S6 is an example .xlsx results file generated by the *Strongyloides* RNA-seq Browser containing a differential gene expression table listing 64 *S. stercoralis* chemoreceptors that are consistently upregulated in iL3s versus all other life stages.  

## MultiQC Reports
Reports summarizing quality controls for raw data and Kallisto alignments. Generated using FastQC v0.11.9 and MultiQC v1.9.

## Supplemental Figures
